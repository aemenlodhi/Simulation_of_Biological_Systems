Various studies have been carried and various models proposed to understand the spread of epidemics in
human populations. The objective of this project was to study the e.ects of network topology of human
contacts and interactions on the spread of disease. This objective has already been the subject of di.erent
papers [6],[3],[7],[4],[5]. This project aimed to undertake a comprehensive survey of di.erent network models
and dynamics of disease spread on them. In this project diff.erent network models were implemented,
classical disease spread models SIR and SIS models were run over these network topologies and their
interaction was explored. The approach undertaken was the same as used by [4]. The following network
models were explored:
1. Random networks
2. Regular networks
3. Scale-free networks [2]
4. Networks with small-world properties [1]
The following epidemic models were implemented over these networks:
1. SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed)
2. SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible)
3. SIRS
The project aimed to understand the following questions:
1. The rate of spread of infections over various network topologies
2. Do some networks have the property that the disease remains localized in certain section of the network?
3. Average life time of a strain on particular network topologies

The parametrization of the network topologies was based on empirical studies [5]. Because of the complexity of modeling dynamic
networks i.e. models where the population remains in flux and the contact links among nodes change over
time, dynamic networks were not be a part of this study. However, it can be taken up as a question for future
studies.
